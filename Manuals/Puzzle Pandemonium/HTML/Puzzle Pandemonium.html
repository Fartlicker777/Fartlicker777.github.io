                <h2>On the Subject of Puzzle Pandemonium</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The consequences of your actions come back to haunt you.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Four 4x4 grids will be shown, but at any point exactly one of them will display information while the others are blacked out. (Editor's note: This could also be like a panel similar to like wire sequence, but I'll let you figure out the logistics and looks lol.)</li>
					<br>
					<li>Each 4x4 grid is a different puzzle, where each cell can be selected to affect that puzzle. You must solve each puzzle shown on the module in order to disarm it.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Each puzzle is linked to another puzzle such that clicking on one cell in the first puzzle will click on the same cell in the second puzzle. It may not be explicit in which puzzles are linked up to which, but the links will be circular.</li>
					<br>
					<li>After an indeterminate amount of clicks, the puzzle you were on will shut off, and a new one will turn on. However, whenever any puzzle is solved it will no longer be able to turn back on, and a new link chain will be formed.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The next page will explain the types of puzzles that can be found on the module as well as their rules.</li>

				<p>(editor note: I am shit at explaining rules of puzzles so if you want you can just reword this altogether)</p>
				<h3>Pipes</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Rotate all the pipes such that they are all connected in a single group.</li>
					<li>All pipes must have each opening connected to another pipe. (i.e. no leaks)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Lights Out</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Each cell can either be on or off.</li>
					<li>Pressing any cell will toggle its state, as well as all other immediate orthogonal neighbors.</li>
					<li>Turn every cell off to complete the puzzle.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Sudoku</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Each cell has a value from one to four.</li>
					<li>Each row and column must have exactly one of each number from one to four.</li>
					<li>Some cells will be filled in beforehand.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Kakurasu</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Each cell can have a black square, and each black square has a value.</li>
					<li>The cell's value for the column is it's position in the column going top to bottom (1-4).</li>
					<li>The cell's value for the row is it's position in the row going left to right (1-4).</li>
					<li>Fill in the grid in such a way that each row and column sums to the values indicated on the sides.</li>
