                <ul>
                    <li>You are playing a game of Telephone with your past selves. Carry on the message sent by your old self and transmit it to your future self.</li>
					<li>At some point during your bomb, you will hear a ringing from the phone. It will ring three times to alert you that a message has arrived.</li>
					<li>Selecting the mod after this happens will show the current message on the display. To submit your answer, dial any number and the module will flip over to reveal a keyboard in which you can type your answer.</li>
					<li>All Telephones will display a message when activated, and hide said message when deactivated.</li>
					<li>Only one Telephone can be active at any given point.</li>
					<li>Each Telephone, excluding the first-ever Telephone, will accept two answers:
						<ul>
							<li>The first answer is based on the previously encrypted message. This applies to previous bombs and deactivated Telephones.</li>
							<li>The second answer is based on the currently displayed message, but requires more work.</li>
							<li>The second answer is nullified if multiple Telephones are on the same bomb and at least one has been deactivated already.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Submitting a message on a Telephone will neither solve nor strike the mod automatically if there are multiple Telephones on the bomb. Instead it will temporarily deactivate until all Telephones on the bomb have had a message inputted. Each Telephone that has incorrectly modified the previous message will strike. A Telephone instance will not strike if it correctly modified a previously incorrect message.</li>
					<li>Refer to the next page for how to encrypt a message.</li>
