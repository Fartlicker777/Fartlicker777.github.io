                <h2>On the Subject of Death Notes</a></h2>

                <ul>
                    <!--<li>You are playing a game of Death Note with your past selves. Carry on the message sent by your old self and transmit it to your future self.</li> -->
					<li>You work for the DOD (Department of the Departed) and are sorting through the profiles of the recently departed. You are almost done with your shift when your dog, Clubstep, starts to shred your bag.</li>
					<br>
					<li>After giving Clubstep back to the Adoption Agency, you noticed that your final report has become mostly illegible. Satan has been pretty pissed off recently (he is always pissed off), so giving him an incomplete report is a surefire way to get you demoted to podcaster.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Using the scrap pieces of paper left from your intel file, piece together the cause of death, the location, the name, and the time of death for each one of the five sinners. Each scrap piece of paper tells you information about a sinner (e.g. a clue could say that Person 1 was named Kavin, or Person 1 was NOT named Kavin.)</li>
					<br>
					<li>Once you determine the correct identifier for a sinner, you can check off the corresponding box. When you believe that all of the information is accurate, then you can hand it off to Satan (by using the big, red, and obvious send button) and hope you do not get demoted for informality. A wrong report will get you demoted to Subway Employee.</li>
					<br>
					<li>A report is only inaccurate when anything in the first column (denoted by Sinner #) that should be a checkmark is not denoted as a checkmark, meaning that you are not required to fill the entire grid. Clicking once on each square will denote an X, meaning that the traits are not linked. Clicking on it again will denote a check, meaning they are linked. Clicking a third time will make it blank.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You can click on the status light to enlarge the grid that you can make the selections on. <b>Holding the status light will flip the mod to show the clues.</b></li>
