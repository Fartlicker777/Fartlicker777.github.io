                    <!--<li>You are playing a game of Evading Hollywood Superstar Shia Labeouf with your past selves. Carry on the message sent by your old self and transmit it to your future self.</li> -->
					<li>You've listened to the tales of The Shia Labeouf, and you know you are not safe in your current location.</li>
					<li>He has started to sprint towards you, and that's when you decide that it's probably a good idea to run as well. With your eidetic memory, you have memorized the entire park's layout from the map at your current location.</li>
					<li>You are also the greatest psychic known to man, and you can tell exactly how long he will chase you for. Find a valid path that takes you from your current location to a new one.
					
					<ul>
						<li>Taking a path too short allows Shia Labeouf to catch up to you and cannibalize the shit out of you.</li>
						<li>Taking a path that is too long means you run the risk of accidentally wandering into him again, which is something you probably don't want to do.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The map you remembered is below:</li>

				<ul>
					<li>Well no, it almost did. Luckily for you, your fatass broke it by stepping on it. In fact you notice that there are a bunch of areas on the path to the cottage that looks like they might have a bear trap to them.</li>
					<li>With your expert deduction skills, you deduce that each tile that has poison ivy on cannot be tread on. On top of that, three tiles directly adjacent to the poison ivy have bear traps on them, although you cannot tell which ones.</li>
					<li>Starting on any tile on the left, find a path that reaches any tile on the right. A copy of the pathway to the cottage can be seen below.</li>
