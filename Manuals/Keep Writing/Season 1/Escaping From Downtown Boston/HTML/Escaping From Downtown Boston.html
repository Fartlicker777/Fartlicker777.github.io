                <ul>
                    <!--<li>You are playing a game of Escape From Downtown Boston with your past selves. Carry on the message sent by your old self and transmit it to your future self.</li> -->
					<li>You have recently been hired by Deaf News LLC as a field journalist. Deaf has decided to give you his hardest job yet: Investigate the rumors of the supposed Mafia King Pin Brendan King. His abode is located in downtown Boston, so you know the job will be tough.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You were doing a superb job until the Rat-Nosed-Scoundrel himself noticed you with his beady eyes, and has sent his henchmen to chase, blind, gag, and murder you. You realized you fucked up.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Fortunately for you, the henchmen are around the different parts of the city, and thusly you do have enough time to haul ass to the subway and make your escape from the city by heading to the subway. With the intel you have received from Chief Information Officer Donald Huffman, you also happen to know which four henchmen are coming for you.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Each henchmen acts differently in attmepts to catch you, but thanks to Donald Huffman, you know exactly how they are going to move.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The map on the next page shows you all possible points that both you and the henchmen can be in. The green points are exceptions, as they are the only way into the subway and thus do not count as points. Crossing paths with a henchmen, or ending up on the same point for that matter, is a surefire way for you to be promoted to a missing person.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The point where you are is marked with a cross, while other henchmen are marked with their respective colors. Refer to the table on the second page to see what color corresponds to what henchman and movement. If a henchman reaches the end of their movement, they repeat from the beginning. The henchmen can also loop around the edges of the city, but you cannot.</li>
