                <p class="flavour-text">Management told us to change our passwords every three months, but we took the superposition instead.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The 5x5 grid will have two letters displayed simultaneously, with the arrow buttons cycling between 5 grids. Each letter is a part of an unscrambled 5-letter word.</li>
					<br>
                    <li>Each grid can have 3 types of squares:
						<ul>
							<li>White squares - Neither letter has a pixel present in that spot.</li>
							<li>Gray squares - Exactly one letter has a pixel present in that spot.</li>
							<li>Black squares - Both letters have a pixel present in that spot.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><i>Editor's note: I couldn't decide between them being XORed or having them be ternary. If you could find a way to do both that isn't dumb, let me know.</i></li>
					<br>
					<li>Determine the two words present and consider both numbers they have next to them:
						<ul>
							<li>If the numbers share parity, press the submit button on the grid whose number correspond to the lower number.</li>
							<li>If the numbers don't share parity, press the submit button on the grid whose number corresponds to the higher number.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><i>Editor's note 2: I had another way of submission where you'd submit the word back into the mod via RGB, where the two words present represent R and G, but I decided against it because I think it would be annoying to input, and RGB is quite overused at this point. I also thought of indexing the two numbers into a table, but decided against it because I like this method more than that one.</i></li>
