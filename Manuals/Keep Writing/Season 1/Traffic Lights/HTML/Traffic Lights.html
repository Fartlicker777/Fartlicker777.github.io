                <ul>
                    <li>You are renouned (and disgraced) physicist Zefod42, and after a horrific accident you are now stuck in a quantum realm.</li>
					<br>
                    <li>This quantum realm is just a really shitty traffic system, but in two states. Fortunately, literally no one drives in the Netherlands, so you don't have to actually worry about other cars. Unfortunately, you are in the superposition of both states, and thus move in both states simultaneously. Both of your states start at different positions.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Traffic lights across quantum states are just the inverse of each other, so while the left grid may have a red light in some spot, the right grid will be green in that exact same spot.</li>
					<br>
                    <li>In order to restore your reality and stabilize yourself, try to find the Reality-Robobitch-Stabilizer-9000 which is located on your map. It is always located at an intersection.</li>
					<br>
					<li>This traffic system has a traffic light at every intersection, but unlike a normal traffic system, parallel traffic lights may not be lit up at the same time. Because you are in a quantum realm, the streets actually wraps around the edges. This means that going right at the right most column will leave you at the left side, without having to deal with any lights.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Failure to obey Schrödinger's traffic laws will obliterate you from reality, so make sure not to run a red light.</li>
					<br>
					<li>As per usual with traffic lights, they are on a timed system. All lights switch either every 3 seconds, or every 5 seconds. While traffic lights in the same intersection may not share the same intervals, lights across quantum states will share intervals.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Once you have returned back to reality, you can try to other send people into the quantum realm when they attend the KTANE 2023 meetup at your house.</li>
