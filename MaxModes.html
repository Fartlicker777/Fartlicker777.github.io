				<td>Despite the heavy RNG I had for doing the beginner strat, it was really fun to learn and pull off. I did have to do it twice because I forgot to record the first time, which was hella annoying. A lot of people say this is underrated on the MML and at this point idunno if it is. Honestly, if you know what you're doing, it's not <i>that</i> bad. You just have to learn the constituent parts first, and then piece them all together; piecing them together is where the difficulty lies. I'd say RNG was the cause of maybe 55% of my deaths, but that's mostly RNG within the first like 30 seconds so it doesn't matter lol.</td>

				<td>I have a rule about not doing max modes that are heavily RNG (ignore UCN lol), and this mode was the reason it took so long for me to touch the original max modes. Then I was made aware of the legendary brandon strat, though I hate using timers since it's not synced up with the game perfectly. It was a nice kinda zen experience, since it wasn't really hard to do, I just had to roll some good rng with certain cases and toy bitchhead.</td>

I originally laid eyes on it because I watched Hotel Hell's completion and I have some considerations on trying Hotel Hell itself, though it will definitely be a bitch to complete.</td>

				<td>I talked about how things are underrated and overrated, this mode is VERY much underrated. The cylindrical surface that the cursor lies upon makes Bonnet so difficult, combined with flipping because of Yendo because muscle memory is a bitch, I think the mode needs to go up quite a bit. Really fun to do though since every run is winnable, and every loss is entirely your fault.</td>

		<h4 style="text-align:center;">Next max modes I'm looking at are Parasitic Pals (#84), Hotel Hell (#23), and S.O.S. (#122).<br>The question is whether or not Orion will be defused before these.</h4>
