				<td>Figure attacking around a Rush interval is RNG on who gets priority (or I don't understand how attack priority works) is the cause for a lot of my deaths. Another huge portion of my deaths are the game not picking up my movements, mainly because the doors don't let you move until they are COMPLETELY open. Mode isn't that hard tho if you just work your way up, starting with no enemies and adding 1 at a time. I added them in the order of Dupe, A90, Screech, Eyes, Figure, Ambush, Halt, Seek, and Rush. It was quite fucking annoying though dying to me not understanding the attack priority or the game not moving when I want it to.</td>

				<td>This is my first true max mode, and it was a complete nightmare to do, though it didn't take me that long after doing normal parasitic pals. I foolishly said <a href="img/Dumbass.png">this</a> and realized after a few attempts why it's so high on the list. Also the day I beat this is a lot of scores on the MML got reranked and 6 very hard max modes got added to the top, leading this one to go to #47 instead of #41. I guess at this point I shouldn't bother salivating over the numbers considering it would take a lot for them to go up the ranks instead of down.<br><br>Fun fact, I only did this because I tried one attempt of it directly after beating normal Parasitic Pals and I got to charge 2. If I didn't get that far, I probably would not have done this mode.</td>

				<td>Despite the heavy RNG I had for doing the beginner strat, it was really fun to learn and pull off. I did have to do it twice because I forgot to record the first time, which was hella annoying. A lot of people say this is underrated on the MML and at this point idunno if it is. Honestly, if you know what you're doing, it's not <i>that</i> bad. You just have to learn the constituent parts first, and then piece them all together; piecing them together is where the difficulty lies. I'd say RNG was the cause of maybe 55% of my deaths, but that's mostly RNG within the first like 30 seconds so it doesn't matter lol.</td>

				<td>I have a rule about not doing max modes that are heavily RNG (ignore UCN lol), and this mode was the reason it took so long for me to touch the original max modes. Then I was made aware of the legendary brandon strat, though I hate using timers since it's not synced up with the game perfectly. It was a nice kinda zen experience, since it wasn't really hard to do, I just had to roll some good rng with certain cases and toy bitchhead.</td>

				<td>I talked about how things are underrated and overrated, this mode is VERY much underrated. The cylindrical surface that the cursor lies upon makes Bonnet so difficult, combined with flipping because of Yendo because muscle memory is a bitch, I think the mode needs to go up quite a bit. Really fun to do though since every run is winnable, and every loss is entirely your fault.</td>
